2. Set up all required positions:
   - **Cast Button**: Click "Detect" then click the fishing cast button in game
   - **Fishing Area**: Click "Detect" then click where you want to cast
   - **Reel Button**: Click "Detect" then click the reel/timing button
   - **Timing Area**: Click "Detect" then click center of the timing circles
3. Save the coordinates

### 3. Calibrate Reel Timing (Important!)
1. Launch the **Reel Timing Tester** from the launcher
2. Set timing area coordinates (center of timing circles)
3. Start monitoring and trigger a reel mini-game in the game
4. Adjust green detection threshold until it properly detects perfect timing
5. Test the detection accuracy

### 4. Start Fishing
1. Launch the **Main Fishing Bot**
2. Review settings in the Configuration tab
3. Adjust reel timing delay based on your reaction preference
4. Click "Start Fishing" or press F1
5. Monitor the activity log for status updates

## Fishing Mechanics

### Two-Step Process
Ragnarok X uses a timing-based fishing system:

1. **CAST PHASE**: 
   - Bot clicks the cast button
   - Bot clicks on the fishing area to cast the line

2. **REEL PHASE**:
   - Bot waits for the timing mini-game to appear
   - Bot detects when timing is perfect (green indicator or circle overlap)
   - Bot clicks the reel button at the optimal moment

## Configuration Options

### Coordinates
- **Cast Button**: Position of the fishing cast button
- **Fishing Area**: Where to cast the fishing line
- **Detection Region**: Area to monitor for bite indicators

### Timing Settings
- **Cast Delay**: Time between casts (randomizable)
- **Bite Timeout**: Maximum wait time for fish bite
- **Reaction Time**: Delay before hooking fish
- **Hook Duration**: How long to hold hook action

### Detection Settings
- **Hook Sensitivity**: Image matching threshold (0.5-1.0)
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Movement detection threshold
- **Color Detection**: Enable color-based bite detection
- **Template Matching**: Use custom image templates

### Safety Features
- **Randomize Timings**: Add variation to prevent detection
- **Anti-detection**: Enable human-like behavior
- **Break Intervals**: Automatic breaks during long sessions
- **Mouse Variation**: Random movement offsets

## Usage Tips

### For Best Results
- Use windowed mode in the game
- Ensure game window is visible (not minimized)
- Start with short test sessions
- Adjust sensitivity based on detection accuracy
- Create custom templates for better recognition

### Safety Recommendations
- Enable randomization features
- Take regular manual breaks
- Don't run for excessive periods
- Monitor bot activity periodically
- Follow game terms of service

## Hotkeys

- **F1**: Start/Resume fishing
- **F2**: Pause fishing
- **F3**: Stop fishing
- **F4**: Emergency stop (immediate halt)
- **F5**: Save debug screenshot (when available)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot doesn't detect fish bites:**
- Increase hook sensitivity in settings
- Check fishing area coordinates
- Ensure game window is visible
- Create better bite indicator templates

**False positive detections:**
- Decrease hook sensitivity
- Adjust detection region size
- Disable conflicting detection methods

**Bot clicks wrong locations:**
- Re-detect coordinates using the coordinate tool
- Check screen resolution hasn't changed
- Verify game is in windowed mode

**Bot stops unexpectedly:**
- Check activity log for error messages
- Verify all required packages are installed
- Run system check from launcher

### Advanced Troubleshooting

1. **Use Testing Tools**: Run the testing tool to verify functionality
2. **Check Templates**: Ensure template images match current game graphics
3. **Debug Mode**: Enable debug info in interface settings
4. **Log Analysis**: Review activity log for specific error patterns

## Template Creation

### Creating Effective Templates
1. Use the Screen Capture Tool to capture game elements
2. Focus on unique, consistent visual indicators
3. Capture templates at different game states
4. Test templates with the testing tool

### Recommended Templates
- `bite_indicator.png` - Exclamation mark or bite symbol
- `bobber_splash.png` - Water splash effect
- `hook_icon.png` - Hook prompt button
- `cast_button.png` - Fishing cast button
